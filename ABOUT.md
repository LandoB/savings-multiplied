## Software Developer



### WELCOME!

#### Thank you for taking the time to review my site. I have worked in IT for over 10 years. I love creating new things, and creating new things through code.

#### I'm an avid coder. When I'm not coding something, I'm spending time with my family. I also enjoy playing Golf, having a good cup of coffee with my friends, and watching Football.

#### I would love an opportunity to chat over a nice cup of coffee about software development, golf, football, soccer or the topic that most interests you.

#### Feel free to look around, and contact me. My Twitter is: [@jrolandobernal](http://twitter.com/jrolandobernal)
